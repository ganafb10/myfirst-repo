    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I will advice him or her to sanitize all user-originating data before it is displayed in the browser, used in SQL queries, etc. 
        Secondly, I will advice that the web server should be configured to use HTTPS, which will encrypts data sent between the client and the server, thus ensuring that cookies, 
        login credentiats etc are not made available for attackers. 
        Thirdly it will be good to use vulnerability scanning tools such as Abbey scan, Acunetix, etc, to perform automated security testing on the site   </p>
